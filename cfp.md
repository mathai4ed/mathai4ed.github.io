# Call for Papers
<!-- The Math-AI workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussing missing elements and major bottlenecks towards demonstrating mathematical reasoning ability in AI systems. We hope that the outcome of the workshop will lead us in meaningful directions towards a generic approach to mathematical reasoning, and shed light on general reasoning mechanisms for artificial intelligence.

In particular, we are but not limited to the following areas of questions: 

Mathematical reasoning vs. general intelligence?

* What is a potential path from mathematical reasoning to general artificial intelligence?
* What is special about mathematical reasoning compared to other reasoning tasks?
* What are the pros and cons of studying mathematical reasoning?
* Can the lessons learned from mathematical reasoning generalize to other reasoning tasks?

What machine learning techniques are we missing in the quest for machines that perform mathematical reasoning?

* How to deal with large action space – hopeless exploration in mathematical reasoning?
* How to design methods that allow flexible planning and jumpy reasoning?
* How to collect large scale datasets for mathematical reasoning?
* Can one augment the dataset by designing good synthetic datasets?
* How do we utilize informal mathematical datasets?
* Human-like theorem proving vs formal theorem proving using ITPs (interactive theorem provers), trade-offs?
* Do we need a special theorem proving assistant for machine learning?

We are also interested in works on other reasoning problems that share similar structures, and can bring great insights to mathematical reasoning, such as,
* Program synthesis
* Code verification
* Retrosynthesis problem
* Text games -->


The MathAI4Ed workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussing how to investigate the *intersection* of mathematics education and AI. We hope a group of experts from a diverse set of backgrounds, institutions, and disciplines to drive progress on these and other real-world education scenarios, and to discuss the promise and challenge of integrating mathematical AI into education. 

In particular, we are but not limited to the following areas of applications: 
- **Teaching**: Intelligent tutoring systems that effectively assist students in math learning.
- **Evaluation**: AI-assisted grading systems like Gradescope and personalized testing platforms like IXL.
- **Assisting**: Symbolic mathematics tools such as Mathematica and Maple in advanced math education.

We are also interested in these applications require key advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning areas such as:
- **Interpretability**: Opening up the “black box” and providing explainable and interpretable AI.
- **Reasoning**: Informal and formal reasoning agents that can communicate and interact with humans.
- **Core methods**: Multimodal and neuro-symbolic approaches in mathematical domains.

We are also interested in works on other problems that integrate mathematical AI into education, such as,
- **Accessibility**: How can AI most effectively aid mathematical education for a diversity of backgrounds?
- **Applications**: Which near- and long-term applications of AI in math education are most impactful?
- **Approaches**: Which research advances are necessary for enabling these applications?
- **Looking forward**: What is the future of mathematical education and research?

### Submission Requirements

Submissions to MathAI4Ed 2021 are limited to 4 pages of content, but may contain an unlimited number of pages for references and appendices. The latter may not necessarily be read by the reviewers. We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings, reproducibility information, etc.) that do not fit in the 4 pages. The review process is double-blind, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately anonymised.

All submissions must be formatted with LaTeX using the [NeurIPS paper format (Adapted)](img/NeurIPS2021_MathAI4ED.zip).

All accepted papers will be presented in a virtual poster session, and some will be selected for oral presentation. We also permit papers that have been recently published or are under submission to another venue. Please mark such papers accordingly upon submission. The page limit for these submissions is 4 pages. Accepted papers will be published on the MathAI4Ed homepage, but are to be considered non-archival.
